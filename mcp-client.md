# MCP Client Options and Recommendations

## 1. Build a New VSCode MCP Client (Extension)

**Pros:**
- Seamless integration with VSCode UI and workflow.
- Can display SSE events (real-time notifications) directly in the chat or a custom panel.
- Leverages VSCode’s extension APIs for notifications, UI, and commands.
- Users don’t need to leave VSCode.

**Cons:**
- Requires knowledge of VSCode extension development (TypeScript, VSCode API).
- More setup and packaging work.
- Limited by VSCode’s UI (though it is flexible).

**Best for:**
- Developer users who live in VSCode and want a polished, integrated experience.

## 2. Build a Custom MCP Client (Web App, Electron, CLI, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Full control over UI/UX—display SSE events however you want (web notifications, popups, dashboards, etc.).
- Can be as simple or advanced as needed.
- Easier to prototype and iterate (especially with web tech).
- No dependency on VSCode’s extension system.

**Cons:**
- Users need to run a separate app (web, desktop, or CLI).
- Not as tightly integrated with VSCode (unless you build a bridge).

**Best for:**
- Maximum flexibility, rapid prototyping, or supporting users outside VSCode.

## 3. Hybrid Approach
- Build a simple web-based MCP client first (to validate SSE/event flow and UI).
- If VSCode integration is needed, embed the web client in a VSCode WebView or port logic to a full extension.

---

## Recommendation

**Start with a custom web-based MCP client:**
- Fastest to build and iterate.
- Fully test SSE/event flow and UI.
- Can port to VSCode extension later if needed.

**Why?**
- Real-time feedback and easy debugging.
- Not locked into VSCode’s APIs from the start.
- Can support both web and VSCode clients in the future.

## Next Steps
1. Build a simple web client (React, Vue, or plain JS) that:
   - Connects to your MCP server
   - Authenticates (JWT)
   - Subscribes to SSE events and displays them in real time
   - Lets you trigger tool calls and see responses
2. (Optional) Later: Wrap this logic in a VSCode extension for in-editor integration.
